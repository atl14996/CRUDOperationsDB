# Week3Day1Homework THIS HOMEWORK FEATURES CRUD OPERATIONS IN A DATABASE (CREATE READ UPDATE DESTROY) AND ALLOWS FOR USERS TO INSERT A NEW STUDENT INTO A DATABASE.  A SECOND ACTIVITY, QUERY UPDATE DELETE ALLOWS THE USER TO SEARCH FOR A STUDENT AND EITHER UPDATE OR DELETE THE STUDENTS RECORD.  CRUD ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DISREGARDED IN THIS PROJECT.  DUE TO HARDWARE ISSUES I WAS UNABLE TO TEST THE SOFTWARE USING AN EMULATOR.
